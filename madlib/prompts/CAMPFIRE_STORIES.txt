[Campfire Stories]It is always fun to chop up some [plural noun] and use them to build a/an [adjective] campfire. Then you get all the [plural noun] to sit around the fire and tell scary stories. You can tell about Ichabod Crane, the [adjective] schoolteacher of Sleepy Hollow and is [adjective] adventures with the headless [noun]. Or you can tell "The Fall of the House of [person in chat]," which was written by Edgar Allen [someone's last name]. Or you can tell about vampires from [place], like the terrible Count [someone's last name], who bit people on the [part of the body] and drank their [type of liquid]. By this time, many of the [adjective] campers with start to shake in ther [article of clothing plural] and will begin yelling for their [relative] and go hide under the [piece of furniture]. Believe me, when it comes to [verb ending in "ing"] a bunch of [plural noun], there's nothing like a real [adjective] ghost story!
